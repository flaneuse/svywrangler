\title{Standardize inputs into a regression model}
\usage{
center_scale(df, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE, cols2ignore = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data frame containing all the data}

\item{center}{binary if the continuous data should be centered (set so mean = 0)}

\item{scale}{binary if the data should be scaled so the new standard deviation is 1 (if centered), or the value divided by the RMS (if not centered). If false, the column will merely be divided by 2 std. dev.}
}
\description{
Standardizes regression input columns to have comparable regression coefficients.
Rules are as follows:
* categoricals: ignore (leave as dummy vars with 0/1)
* binaries: ignore (leave as 0/1)
* continuous: divide by 2 std dev. if scale = F; or reset so sd = 1, mean = 0 if center = T, scale = T; divided by root mean squared if scale = T, center = F
